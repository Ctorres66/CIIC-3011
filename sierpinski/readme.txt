I decided to make a Sierpinski carpet. This carpet starts with a square in the
center. Then in further levels creates 8 squares around the original squares.
Each square is 1/8th the size of the original square. The square in the middle
will always be black while every other square will change its color to a random
one out of a selection of 8. After googling more information on seirpinski
formations in general, i came across this one, and decided to make a program
not only for it's simplicity, but also for how designs that used this pattern
really caught my attention.
